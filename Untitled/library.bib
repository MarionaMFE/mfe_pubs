abstract = {Wind-generated ocean waves drive important coastal processes that determine flooding and erosion. Ocean warming has been one factor affecting waves globally. Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4{\%} per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.},

abstract = {Approximately 60{\%} of emerging human pathogens are zoonoses. The complex nature of the human-animal interface is constantly influenced by the effects of climate change, anthropogenic and natural factors. Geoclimatic change most markedly affects zoonotic diseases transmitted by arthropod vectors. Travel, tourism and trade are the major human factors impacting the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. The re-emergence of zoonotic diseases is also driven by pathogen adaptation and animal migration. All these factors converge to make zoonotic diseases such as West Nile fever and Lyme disease of great public health concern in the developed world. However, the effects of climate change are predicted to be worse for the developing world where challenging socioeconomic and political environments are exacerbated by a lack of epidemiological studies on zoonotic diseases. {\textcopyright} Under License of Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.},

abstract = {Previous studies evaluating anthropogenic influences on the meteorological drivers of drought have found mixed results owing to (1) the complex physical mechanisms which lead to the onset of drought, (2) differences in the characteristics and time scales of drought for different regions of the world, and (3) different approaches to the question of attribution. For a midlatitude, temperate climate like New Zealand, strongly modulated by oceanic influences, summer droughts last on the order of 3 months, and are less strongly linked to persistent temperature anomalies than continental climates. Here we demonstrate the utility of a novel approach for characterizing the meteorological conditions conducive to extreme drought over the North Island of New Zealand, using the January-March 2013 event as a case study. Specifically, we consider the use of self-organizing map techniques in a multimember coupled climate model ensemble to capture changes in daily circulation, between two 41 year periods (1861-1901 and 1993-2033). Comparisons are made with seasonal pressure and precipitation indices. Our results demonstrate robust ({\textgreater}99{\%} confidence) increases in the likelihood of observing circulation patterns like those of the 2013 drought in the recent-climate simulations when compared with the early-climate simulations. Best guess estimates of the fraction of attributable risk range from 0.2 to 0.4, depending on the metric used and threshold considered. Contributions to uncertainty in these attribution statements are discussed.},

abstract = {Compilation of modern and historical length change records for Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers demonstrates that these glaciers have lost {\~{}}3km in length and at least 3-4km2 in area since the 1800s, with the greatest overall loss occurring between 1934 and 1983. Within this dramatic and ongoing retreat, both glaciers have experienced periods of re-advance. The record from Franz Josef Glacier is the most detailed, and shows major advances from 1946 to 1951 (340m), 1965-1967 (400m), 1983-1999 (1420m) and 2004-2008 (280m). At Fox Glacier the record is similar, with advances recorded during 1964-1968 (60m), 1985-1999 (710m) and 2004-2008 (290m). Apart from the latest advance event, the magnitude of advance has been greater at Franz Josef Glacier, suggesting a higher length sensitivity. Analysis of the relationship between glacier length and a reconstructed annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) record shows that the glaciers react very quickly to ELA variations - with the greatest correlation at 3-4years' lag. The present (2014) retreat is the fastest retreat in the records of both glaciers. While decadal length fluctuations have been linked to hemispheric ocean-atmosphere variability, the overall reduction in length is a clear sign of twentieth century warming. However, documenting glacier length changes can be challenging; especially when increased surface debris-cover makes identification of the 'true' terminus a convoluted process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With a population of 4.5 million, New Zealand's contribution to total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is relatively low. On a per capita basis, however, New Zealand's GHG emissions are the fifth highest among Annex 1 countries, due in part to the relative size of the pastoral agricultural sector. Biophysical impacts of climate change will largely extend current climate trends, with high regional variability. A review of climate change literature identifies three key risks for New Zealand relating to economic connectedness, perceptions of 'clean, green' New Zealand, and social equity. Since 2008, New Zealand's main mitigation response has been the emissions trading scheme (NZ ETS), yet the ETS is currently providing little by way of meaningful incentives for behavior change and low-carbon investment. Moreover, since declining to enter the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol, engagement with global climate governance has been modest, and recently released emissions reduction targets have raised questions over New Zealand's responsibilities as a global citizen. In this paper, adaptive responses are considered in connection to key industries (agriculture, tourism) and communities (coastal, MƒÅori), and examine the devolved structure of adaptation. Mainstream media reporting of climate change in New Zealand appears to be aligned with the scientific consensus position, yet it continues to frame climate change as a political issue, prioritizing political over scientific voices. Public perceptions of climate change provide evidence of continued uncertainty relating to human attribution, and depict climate change as a spatially distanced risk which could affect support for government action on climate change.},

abstract = {Background: Ongoing climate change might, through rising temperatures, alter allergenic pollen biology across the northern hemisphere. We aimed to analyse trends in pollen seasonality and pollen load and to establish whether there are specific climate-related links to any observed changes. Methods: For this retrospective data analysis, we did an extensive search for global datasets with 20 years or more of airborne pollen data that consistently recorded pollen season indices (eg, duration and intensity). 17 locations across three continents with long-term (approximately 26 years on average) quantitative records of seasonal concentrations of multiple pollen (aeroallergen) taxa met the selection criteria. These datasets were analysed in the context of recent annual changes in maximum temperature (T max ) and minimum temperature (T min ) associated with anthropogenic climate change. Seasonal regressions (slopes) of variation in pollen load and pollen season duration over time were compared to T max , cumulative degree day T max , T min , cumulative degree day T min , and frost-free days among all 17 locations to ascertain significant correlations. Findings: 12 (71{\%}) of the 17 locations showed significant increases in seasonal cumulative pollen or annual pollen load. Similarly, 11 (65{\%}) of the 17 locations showed a significant increase in pollen season duration over time, increasing, on average, 0{\textperiodcentered}9 days per year. Across the northern hemisphere locations analysed, annual cumulative increases in T max over time were significantly associated with percentage increases in seasonal pollen load (r=0{\textperiodcentered}52, p=0{\textperiodcentered}034) as were annual cumulative increases in T min (r=0{\textperiodcentered}61, p=0{\textperiodcentered}010). Similar results were observed for pollen season duration, but only for cumulative degree days (higher than the freezing point [0¬∞C or 32¬∞F]) for T max (r=0{\textperiodcentered}53, p=0{\textperiodcentered}030) and T min (r=0{\textperiodcentered}48, p=0{\textperiodcentered}05). Additionally, temporal increases in frost-free days per year were significantly correlated with increases in both pollen load (r=0{\textperiodcentered}62, p=0{\textperiodcentered}008) and pollen season duration (r=0{\textperiodcentered}68, p=0{\textperiodcentered}003) when averaged for all 17 locations. Interpretation: Our findings reveal that the ongoing increase in temperature extremes (T min and T max ) might already be contributing to extended seasonal duration and increased pollen load for multiple aeroallergenic pollen taxa in diverse locations across the northern hemisphere. This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health‚Äîone that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase.

@article{Wardle1992,
abstract = {Since the 1860s New Zealand mean air temperatures have risen about 0.5¬∞C, which might be expected to have led to a rise of about 100 m in altitudinal limits of plants. Four tree species were examined at several South Island localities for evidence of such a rise. Young silver beech plants have established above the upper limit of mature trees, mostly within the last 60 years. However, as beech timberlines are strongly buffered, few of these young plants occur more than 9 m from the forest margin. Above mountain beech timberlines, which lie in drier climates east of the Main Divide, the ‚Äúadvance zone‚Äù is usually less than 7 m wide, and does not include the exposed spurs and northerly faces where timberline ascends highest. Above the limit of mature red beech trees, there is a zone in which younger red beech, up to 150 years old, occur through nearly 30 m of altitude. Scanty data for miro suggest a still wider advance zone. The difference between the potential altitudinal rise of upper limits and that which is actually achieved suggests that in the event of rapid and substantial climatic change, species with intrinsically slow rates of spread would be unable to keep pace. Those with narrow environmental ranges could be threatened with extinction unless managed so as to assist dispersal and establishment.To substantiate the prima facie findings of this study, transects have been set up to monitor long term future changes. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Despite increasing concern about elevated extinction risk as global temperatures rise, it is difficult to confirm causal links between climate change and extinction. By coupling 25 years of in situ climate manipulation with experimental seed introductions and both historical and current plant surveys,we identify causal, mechanistic links between climate change and the local extinction of a widespread mountain plant (Androsace septentrionalis). Climate warming causes precipitous declines in population size by reducing fecundity and survival acrossmultiple life stages. Climate warming also purges belowground seed banks, limiting the potential for the future recovery of at-risk populations under ameliorated conditions. Bolstered by previous reports of plant community shifts in this experiment and in other habitats, our findings not only support the hypothesis that climate change can drive local extinction but also foreshadow potentially widespread species losses in subalpine meadows as climate warming continues.},

@article{Cradock-Henry2017,
abstract = {Commercial cultivation of kiwifruit in New Zealand is concentrated in a relatively small area of the North Island. Cultivation is economically significant and growing quickly. However, current understanding of vulnerability for this, and other primary sector activities in New Zealand, makes almost exclusive use of linear outcome-oriented frameworks. Drawing on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with kiwifruit growers and orchard managers, workshops and analysis of secondary data, a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù contextual assessment of vulnerability was developed and empirically applied. The findings suggest that climate and markets are the main sources of exposure for growers, with sensitivity moderated by location. Growers employ mostly short-term, reactive adaptive strategies to manage climate exposure and sensitivity, but have less capacity to respond to market-related stressors. Warmer and drier conditions are likely to have adverse effects for kiwifruit production and compound existing vulnerabilities. An ageing population and other processes of rural change may also constrain future adaptation. In order to realise opportunities and minimise losses, longer-term strategic responses are required. The paper demonstrates the need to move beyond outcome-oriented and model-based vulnerability assessments in New Zealand, to consider the broad range of the factors that contribute to vulnerability in the nation's agricultural sectors. It provides a basis for further consideration of multiple exogenous impacts in the industry and confirms the critical importance of qualitatively vulnerability assessments to determine spatially specific outcomes.},

abstract = {Climate change is affecting New Zealand and the health of New Zealanders as many factors that contribute to our health and well-being are threatened by climate change. Over time, increasing climate change will lead to our health being impacted more severely, and more of us will be affected. Direct effects from climate change include increased exposure to heat waves and weather events, flooding and fires. Indirect environmental effects from climate change include increased exposure to microbial contamination, pollen, particulate air pollutants and carriers of new diseases. Indirect social effects from climate change include disruption to health services, social and economic factors including migration, housing and livelihood stresses, food security, socioeconomic deprivation and health inequality. The consequences of climate change are also expected to have adverse mental health and community health effects. The effects of climate change will not be spread evenly across the population, exacerbating existing socioeconomic and ethnic health inequalities. Well-designed policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions will not only limit climate change and reduce the associated risks to human health, but have the potential to improve population health and reduce health inequalities. More research is needed to better quantify the health impacts of climate change for New Zealand in the short, medium and long term, particularly where impacts are indirect.},
